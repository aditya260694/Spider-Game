HELP

The game is designed such that in each column a spider is present at all times. The cannon , red basket and green basket can be selected using b,r,g respectively as specified. The selected object will be highlighted .  The cannon can fire the laser on pressing spacebar. P can be used to pause/unpause and q is used to exit. The left and right arrow keys are used to move the baskets and the cannon around.

On clicking the mouse on any object it can get selected. They can then be dragged or clicked to a different location, provided no obstacles are in the way. Clicking the right mouse button on the cannon and dragging it will make the cannon face the pointer if it is above the ground level.

The cannon can be dragged by mouse clicking to any location at the base. The baskets cannont cross an obstacle.

The cannon fires in intervals of 1 second.if a spider falls on the cannon the game is over. If a spider reaches the ground, it blocks that space and none of the other objects except the next spider can use that space.
